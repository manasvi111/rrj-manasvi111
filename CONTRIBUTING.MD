### Authentication and Authorization Stratergies
This project demonstrates the implementation of different authentication and authorization strategies using the Strategy design pattern.

### Background
As a developer, I was assigned to work on resolving an issue related to implementing authentication and authorization strategies within our project. The issue (#67) was specifically related to JavaScript, which made it particularly appealing to me as I have previous experience working with JavaScript.

### Problem statement
The task involved implementing various authentication and authorization strategies using the Strategy design pattern to ensure flexibility and extensibility within our application.

## Solution Overview
### Authentication Stratergies
The project utilizes two authentication strategies:
1. Basic Authentication Strategy: 
Implements basic authentication by checking provided credentials against predefined credentials.
2. OAuth Authentication Strategy: 
 Implements OAuth authentication by validating provided tokens.

### Authorization Stratergies
Two authorization strategies are implemented:
1. Role-based Authorization Strategy: Authorizes users based on their roles.
2. Permission-based Authorization Strategy: Authorizes users based on their permissions.

## Implementation
### Files and Structures
The main implementation is contained within the "example.js" file. It consists of classes and functions defining the authentication and authorization strategies.

### Usage Examples
The example.js file provides usage examples for both authentication and authorization:
   - Authentication: Demonstrates how to authenticate users using both basic and OAuth strategies.
   - Authorization: Shows how to authorize users based on roles and permissions.

### Design Pattern
The implementation follows the Strategy design pattern, which allows for interchangeable authentication and authorization strategies without altering the client code.

### Development Process
1. Issue Identification
I reviewed the issues section and found issue #67, which was related to implementing JavaScript-based authentication and authorization strategies.

2. Research and Understanding
Before diving into the implementation, I researched different authentication and authorization strategies, as well as the Strategy design pattern to ensure a comprehensive understanding of the task.

3. Implementation
Based on my understanding and the requirements outlined in the issue, I implemented the authentication and authorization strategies using JavaScript, following best practices and design patterns.

4. Testing and Refinement
After implementation, I thoroughly tested the functionality to ensure it met the specified requirements. Any bugs or issues encountered were addressed and refined.
References

Throughout the development process, I referred to various online resources and documentation, including:

   - MDN Web Docs for JavaScript reference.
   -  Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software by Erich Gamma, Richard Helm, Ralph Johnson, and John Vlissides.
   - Online tutorials and articles on authentication and authorization strategies.

### Outcome
The implementation successfully addressed the issue #67 by providing flexible and extensible authentication and authorization mechanisms within the project, enhancing its security and usability.
