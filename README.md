# Research and Reflection journal
Here, in this journal I am including my work on weekly basis and the content regarding my community project strating from week 8 to week 14.

# Week 8
## Activity 1: Research a new language
### Processing Programming language
Processing is an open-source programming language and environment designed for artists, designers, educators, and beginners to create visual arts, interactive installations, and multimedia projects. Developed by Ben Fry and Casey Reas at the MIT Media Lab in 2001, Processing is built on top of Java and extends its syntax to make it more accessible for creative coding purposes.
