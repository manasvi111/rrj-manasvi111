- Display images and descriptions for each menu item.
- Include pricing information for each menu item.
- Allow users to add items to their cart directly from the menu.
  
### User Story 3: Customization Options
"As a user, I want to customize my food order (e.g., toppings, sauce choices) so that I can tailor it to my preferences."

### Acceptance Criteria:

- Provide customization options for applicable menu items (e.g., pizza toppings, burger add-ons).
- Allow users to specify quantity and preferences for each customization option.
- Display any additional costs associated with selected customizations.
- Ensure that customized orders are accurately reflected in the final order summary.

## Activity 3: Choose a language for community code

For the selection of the language for community code I would like to choose Javascript because this is the wordwide language which is widely accepted by many of us.

Moreover, JavaScript is a popular programming language for web and mobile development. It has a large, active community with abundant resources and tools available. The language's versatility allows for a wide range of potential projects within the Community Code scope.

## Activity 3: Star Github topics and repositories of interests 

As part of preparing for the Community Code project, I spent time exploring the GitHub Explore tab and various sections to discover and star topics and repositories of interest. Through this process, I have now starred a total of 6 GitHub topics and repositories that I believe will be valuable for the project.

The topics and repositories I have starred include:
- Bootstrap
- ASP.NET
- Azure
- Amazon web services
- Code quality
- Code review
- Learning E-commerce (https://github.com/hinchley2018/learning-ecommerce)

## Activity 4: Follow-up questions and reflections
Interesting thing learned from researching programming languages:

### Answer 1
One of the really interesting things I've learned from researching programming languages is just how diverse and specialized they can be. It's not like there's one language that's the clear "best" - it really depends on the specific needs of the project and the developer's goals. I was reading through some of the other students' responses, and it was cool to see how they were gravitating towards languages like JavaScript, Python, and Kotlin. Those do seem to be gaining a lot of popularity these days, especially for web, mobile, and data-focused applications.

### Answer 2
As for what other languages I might consider for DGL 104, a couple that caught my eye were TypeScript and Kotlin. TypeScript is this really neat superset of JavaScript that adds static typing, which I think could be super helpful for writing more robust, maintainable code. And Kotlin, well, that just seems to be taking the Android development world by storm. I'm curious to learn more about how it compares to Java and whether it could be a good fit for some mobile app projects.

### Answer 3
when I was exploring GitHub, I was really blown away by just how much stuff is out there. I mean, I came across all these repositories that were jam-packed with all kinds of libraries, frameworks, and tools for different programming languages. It was like a treasure trove of resources!

And then, on top of that, I found these other repositories that were all about getting involved in open-source projects and contributing back to the community. That really resonated with me, especially since that's such a big part of what we're trying to do with the Community Code project.

# Week 9
## Community code Project

## Activity 1: Read the community code assignment

This is a really cool assignment I've got here. For my open-source project, I think this is a great opportunity to get my hands dirty and really dive into the community. The way I see it, I've got all sorts of options in terms of how I can contribute.

I could write some code to help fix bugs or add new features. That's always super valuable for open-source projects. Or, if coding isn't my strong suit, I could always lend a hand with creating tutorials or improving the documentation. That kind of stuff is just as important, because it helps make the project more accessible and user-friendly for everyone.

## Activity 2: Read "How to contribute to open source".

Here is a summary and reflection on what I've learned about contributing to open source projects from the "How to Contribute to Open Source" guide:

### Summary

The GitHub Open Source Guides provide a comprehensive overview of what it means to contribute to open source projects. The key takeaways are:

1. **Variety of Contributions**: Open source contributions can take many forms beyond just writing code, such as reporting bugs, improving documentation, creating tutorials, and more. The guide emphasizes that all types of contributions are valuable.

2. **Finding the Right Project**: The guide suggests exploring resources like GitHub's Explore page, Open Source Friday, and searching for projects with "good first issues" to find an open source project that aligns with your interests and skills.

3. **Setting Expectations**: Open source projects often have contribution guidelines that outline how to properly submit issues, pull requests, and interact with the community. Following these guidelines is important for making effective contributions.

4. **Building Community**: Healthy open source communities foster respectful, constructive dialogue. Things like a code of conduct and encouraging mentorship can help create a welcoming environment for new contributors.

### Reflection

After reviewing the guide, I feel inspired to get more involved in open source projects. The variety of contribution opportunities beyond just coding is really appealing, as I may be able to leverage my strengths in areas like documentation and community engagement.

I'm particularly interested in exploring some of the GitHub Explore resources to find a project that aligns with my interests and skills. The "good first issues" concept seems like a great way to get my feet wet and make meaningful contributions, even as a newcomer.

Understanding the importance of following project-specific contribution guidelines and building positive relationships within the community is also crucial. I want to be mindful of being a respectful, collaborative member rather than just focusing on my own goals.

Overall, this guide has given me a much clearer picture of what effective open source contribution looks like. I'm excited to put these lessons into practice as I identify a project to get involved with for the Community Code assignment.

## Find potential projects to contribute to:

1. Here is a summary of the Workbox project based on the provided search results:

# Week 11
## Read through pattern library issues

For this assignment, I already visited some issues and I reviwed their code and gave them suggestions accordingly. Till now, mainly I gave my contribution to 3 issues so far. The first one was PR #89, PR #87 and PR #88. I gave them my suggestions with the help of comment section and they have akready applied thatin their code after words.

As a personal assignment, I have worked on the issue of PR #67.

Here, I am providing both links for my both projects.   
- [Pattern-library](https://github.com/manasvi111/pattern-library) - (Readme.md and example.js)
- [Community code](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/workbox/compare/v7...manasvi111:workbox:optional?expand=1) - (Readme.md(Documentation))

For the external community code, I worked in actual community by helping them with their documentation and contrbuting file. After making changes, I submitted pull requests for review by the Workbox team. I already merged the branch and waiting for them to give me any comments or suggestion about how I can improve or what I missed.

Please have a look at my work of my actual [project-readme](https://github.com/manasvi111/workbox/blob/optional/project-Readme.md) file of the external community contrbution.

# Reflections:
## Internal Community code:
- By working on this assignment, I got to know about many things such as; this may sounds silly but earlier I didn't know how to create and close the issues, how can I comment on others work, what could be my contribution to thers and how others can effectively use this feature that was completely new to me like I never discovered that feature of the github because I never had to.
- secondly, the way of creating fork and branches to work on those issues was also new to me.
- But ultimately after connecting all the dots that all makes sense and it was great experience to work on that feature.

## External Community Code:
- For the person who never seen such things this was the huge step to work on the external community. But from finding the potential project for my self to contribute in it I learnt many major factors of the real world.
- The way of they all are working, the system, team work, management, contrbution, problem solving, testing all the major roles of the execution I learnt in this module. And this was the wonderful experince overall.

## Reseach and Journal:
- Along with the other assignments, we were assigned to do this journal. It was helpful for me to follow the steps one by one for the better understanding and to stick onto the required and recommended things only. By this activity I was clear about what to do only so it helped me to avoid the confusion. And believe me this was the big help.
