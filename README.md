# Research and Reflection journal
Here, in this journal I am including my work on weekly basis and the content regarding my community project strating from week 8 to week 14.

# Week 8
## Activity 1: Research a new language
### Processing Programming language
Processing is an open-source programming language and environment designed for artists, designers, educators, and beginners to create visual arts, interactive installations, and multimedia projects. Developed by Ben Fry and Casey Reas at the MIT Media Lab in 2001, Processing is built on top of Java and extends its syntax to make it more accessible for creative coding purposes.

### Key features and aspects of Processing:
- Simplicity
- Graphics and multimedia
- Interactivity
- Community
- Cross-platform
- Integration
- Education

### Uses of Processing language

Processing is utilized in various fields of development:

1. Creative Coding: Processing is primarily known for its use in creative coding projects, where it enables artists and designers to create interactive visualizations, animations, and generative artworks.

2. Education: Processing is widely used as an educational tool to teach programming concepts, particularly in the context of visual arts and interactive media. Its simplicity and visual feedback make it accessible for beginners.

3. Data Visualization: Processing is employed to create interactive data visualizations and infographics, allowing users to explore and understand complex datasets through interactive and visually engaging representations.

4. Prototyping: Processing is often used for rapid prototyping of interactive applications and interfaces. Its quick feedback loop and easy integration with hardware make it suitable for creating prototypes of interactive installations and physical computing projects.

### Companies and Organizations Using Processing:
Several companies and organizations incorporate Processing into their projects, products, or internal systems:

1. MIT Media Lab: The Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) Media Lab, a research laboratory at MIT, frequently utilizes Processing in its projects related to interactive media, creative technologies, and digital art.

2. Google Creative Lab: Google Creative Lab, a creative think tank within Google, has used Processing in various experimental projects and interactive installations, leveraging its capabilities for creative coding and rapid prototyping.

3. The New York Times: The New York Times has employed Processing in several interactive data visualization projects, allowing readers to explore and interact with complex data stories in engaging ways.

### Resources to Learn Processing:
Several online resources are available for learning Processing:

1. Processing.org: The official website of Processing provides comprehensive documentation, tutorials, and examples to help beginners get started with the language and explore its features.

2. The Coding Train: The Coding Train YouTube channel, created by Daniel Shiffman, offers a series of tutorials and creative coding challenges using Processing, aimed at beginners and intermediate learners.

3. OpenProcessing: OpenProcessing is an online platform for sharing and exploring interactive sketches and visualizations created with Processing. It offers a wealth of community-contributed projects and tutorials for learning and inspiration.

By exploring these resources, individuals can gain a solid understanding of Processing and its applications in creative coding, data visualization, and interactive media.

## Activity 2: User stories:

Feature: Food Delivery Service

### User Story 1: Browse Restaurants
"As a food-holic user, I want to browse available restaurants so that I can choose where to order food from."

### Acceptance Criteria:

- Display a list of nearby restaurants with their names and cuisines.
- Allow the user to filter restaurants by cuisine type.
- Provide information about the restaurant's opening hours and delivery times.
- Enable sorting options such as distance or ratings.

### User Story 2: Menu Exploration
"As a user, I want to explore the menu of a selected restaurant so that I can decide what to order."

### Acceptance Criteria:

- Present the menu categories (e.g., appetizers, main courses, desserts) clearly.
- Display images and descriptions for each menu item.
- Include pricing information for each menu item.
- Allow users to add items to their cart directly from the menu.
  
### User Story 3: Customization Options
"As a user, I want to customize my food order (e.g., toppings, sauce choices) so that I can tailor it to my preferences."

### Acceptance Criteria:

- Provide customization options for applicable menu items (e.g., pizza toppings, burger add-ons).
- Allow users to specify quantity and preferences for each customization option.
- Display any additional costs associated with selected customizations.
- Ensure that customized orders are accurately reflected in the final order summary.

## Activity 3: Choose a language for community code

For the selection of the language for community code I would like to choose Javascript because this is the wordwide language which is widely accepted by many of us.

Moreover, JavaScript is a popular programming language for web and mobile development. It has a large, active community with abundant resources and tools available. The language's versatility allows for a wide range of potential projects within the Community Code scope.

## Activity 3: Star Github topics and repositories of interests 

As part of preparing for the Community Code project, I spent time exploring the GitHub Explore tab and various sections to discover and star topics and repositories of interest. Through this process, I have now starred a total of 6 GitHub topics and repositories that I believe will be valuable for the project.

The topics and repositories I have starred include:
- Bootstrap
- ASP.NET
- Azure
- Amazon web services
- Code quality
- Code review
- Learning E-commerce (https://github.com/hinchley2018/learning-ecommerce)

## Activity 4: Follow-up questions and reflections
Interesting thing learned from researching programming languages:

### Answer 1
One of the really interesting things I've learned from researching programming languages is just how diverse and specialized they can be. It's not like there's one language that's the clear "best" - it really depends on the specific needs of the project and the developer's goals. I was reading through some of the other students' responses, and it was cool to see how they were gravitating towards languages like JavaScript, Python, and Kotlin. Those do seem to be gaining a lot of popularity these days, especially for web, mobile, and data-focused applications.

### Answer 2
As for what other languages I might consider for DGL 104, a couple that caught my eye were TypeScript and Kotlin. TypeScript is this really neat superset of JavaScript that adds static typing, which I think could be super helpful for writing more robust, maintainable code. And Kotlin, well, that just seems to be taking the Android development world by storm. I'm curious to learn more about how it compares to Java and whether it could be a good fit for some mobile app projects.

### Answer 3
when I was exploring GitHub, I was really blown away by just how much stuff is out there. I mean, I came across all these repositories that were jam-packed with all kinds of libraries, frameworks, and tools for different programming languages. It was like a treasure trove of resources!

And then, on top of that, I found these other repositories that were all about getting involved in open-source projects and contributing back to the community. That really resonated with me, especially since that's such a big part of what we're trying to do with the Community Code project.

# Week 9
## Community code Project

### Activity 1: Read the community code assignment

This is a really cool assignment I've got here. For my open-source project, I think this is a great opportunity to get my hands dirty and really dive into the community. The way I see it, I've got all sorts of options in terms of how I can contribute.

I could write some code to help fix bugs or add new features. That's always super valuable for open-source projects. Or, if coding isn't my strong suit, I could always lend a hand with creating tutorials or improving the documentation. That kind of stuff is just as important, because it helps make the project more accessible and user-friendly for everyone.
